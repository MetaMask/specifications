# MetaMask Wallet Specification

This repository is designed to represent the MetaMask wallet in its current state, quirks and platform inconsistencies and all, so that changes may be proposed, and those issues and pull requests may be used to facilitate conversation and process towards the deliberate evolution of the wallet experience across platforms and products, either to consolidate platform differences or emphasize and relish them.

## Specification Principles

### Incremental Completeness

Since the wallet evolved to its current state without this specification existing yet, and is a project in motion, it would be impractical to try to complete this specification before inviting participation in its evolution. For that reason, it should be assumed that at any moment this document is incomplete, and so contributions to this repository should make clear whether they are:

- Clarifications of current state (simply requires verification to merge)
- Proposals for revisions of state in one or more product (requires completion in the proposed products to merge)

Just to emphasize again, I'm proposing this repository represents _the current state of the wallet, with all of its flaws_, and any changes merged to it should represent those changes being "done" in the wallet itself.
